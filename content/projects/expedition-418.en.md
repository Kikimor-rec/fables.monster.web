**Expedition-418** is a tabletop extraction RPG about robots of all sizes performing critically important missions in dangerous environments. Inspired by extraction shooters, the game brings the tense "get in, complete the objective, get out" gameplay loop to the tabletop.

### What is this game about?

You play as robots — from tiny scout units to hulking industrial machines — sent on extraction missions. Your objectives vary: retrieve valuable cargo, rescue stranded units, gather intel, or simply survive long enough to make it back to base.

### Key Features

*   **Unique Robot Creation System**: Build your robot from the ground up. Choose your chassis, install modules, calibrate sensors. Every robot is different, every mission requires adaptation.
*   **Extraction Gameplay**: Get in, complete the objective, get out. Simple in theory, chaotic in practice. Equipment breaks down, plans fall apart, backup never arrives on time.
*   **Flexible Session Length**: Run quick 2-hour one-shots full of absurd situations, or build extended campaigns with character progression and evolving storylines.
*   **Dangerous and Absurd Situations**: From navigating collapsing facilities to negotiating with malfunctioning AI — expect both high tension and unexpected humor.

### Game Parameters

*   **Players**: 2-5
*   **Session Duration**: 2-4 hours
*   **Campaign Support**: Yes
*   **One-shots**: Yes

### Current Status
