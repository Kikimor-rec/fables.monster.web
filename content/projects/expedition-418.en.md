**Expedition-418** is a tabletop RPG about robots on dangerous missions. You build your robot from parts: chassis, frame, manipulators, sensor arrays, processing core. Every build has its strengths and weaknesses, and every mission tests them.

The core of the game is the extraction loop: get in, complete the objective, get out before everything starts falling apart. It usually falls apart anyway.

Play quick one-shots or run extended campaigns. Break down, repair, adapt.
