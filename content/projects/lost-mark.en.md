Your ship drops out of hyperspace near a black hole. Amid the debris drifts the **Ship of the Lost**—a grotesque fusion of dozens of vessels. Aboard festers **Mark Opollo**, a pilot who merged with the ship 217 years ago. His flesh is metal. His mind is the network. Hidden within is a cryopod with a child—the final piece for Mark's "ascension."

Players must choose: **stop this... or let it happen.**
