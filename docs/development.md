# Development Setup

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`. Configure environment variables in `.env.local` for features such as email sending (see README).

Use `npm run lint` to check code style and `npm run build` to create a production build.
